                  OKUPA was a platform for renting commercial spaces.

                <p>
                  The objective was to make available spaces that were not being used within companies or commercial properties so that other people could use them.

                <p>
                  In this company, I was solely responsible for the project and worked alone in its development. 
                  The CEO bought a third-party system and needed maintenance.
